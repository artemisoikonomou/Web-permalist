# Permalist

Permalist started as a basic to-do list web application developed during a seminar. The original version included foundational functionality such as adding, editing, and deleting notes, with basic CSS for layout and styling. After the seminar, the project was significantly expanded with practical, user-focused features, transforming it into a more complete productivity tool.

This web application lets you create and manage notes, categorize them, flag important items, track progress with a visual progress bar, and view timestamps for each note. It also includes login and signup forms for basic user authentication, making it a structured and personalized productivity tool with a clean, distraction-free interface.

The project is built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and PostgreSQL (database file included). To run it, install Node.js, download or clone the project, navigate to the folder in your terminal, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and `npm start` to launch the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). All necessary dependencies are listed in `package.json`, and the included database file allows the app to function immediately.
